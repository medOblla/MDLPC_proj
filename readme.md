## Project objectif : 
Explore at least five supervised models from the list below, to make a forecast of the target variable Display (Y) using as independent variables X1...X7. 

Of the proposed models, at least two approaches based on a Datamart with nominal features - consider discretizing the continuous variables intelligently (MDLPC)  

## What is required to turn in : 

**Input :** Describe any transformation of the input if different from the initial input (New formatting of the input data for a model application) 
**Model :** 
- Briefly describe the model 
- Define the role of each parameter and how the model parameters are fitted (setup & fitting parameters)    
**Output:** 
- Comment on the result of each model 
- Compare the different models 

### Try the models 

- **Logit model**: The logit model, also known as a logistic regression model, is used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability of the target variable being a certain class given the independent variables.

- **ADL model**: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a method used for classification and dimensionality reduction. It aims to find a linear combination of the independent variables that best separates the different classes of the target variable.

- **Decision tree**: Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. They work by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of the independent variables.

- **Random Forest**: A random forest is an ensemble of decision trees. The idea is to average the predictions of many trees to reduce the variance and increase the accuracy of the model.

- **Neural network**: Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They can be used for a wide range of problems, including classification and regression.

- **Gradient Boosting machine**: Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.

- **Support Vector Machine**: SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression problems. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximally separates the different classes of the target variable.
